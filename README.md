# HR Analytics Dashboard | Python, Pandas, Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using an HR dataset and presents insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🔄 Data Cleaning (Python)
Before building the dashboard, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python (pandas):

- Removed irrelevant and constant columns
- Checked for duplicated values
- Checked for null values

The dashboard helps answer:
- Why are employees leaving?
- Which departments and roles have the highest attrition?
- How do factors like salary, overtime, tenure, and work-life balance affect attrition?
